# My 3380 SvelteKit Project

## Why?

This is to provide a way to execute and practice writing JavaScript and TypeScript code that will run in either the browser or on a server. This is a way to learn how to write code that can be used in a variety of environments.

## Running the project

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
